Green-Stock-Analysis
Project Overview
Background
Steve wants to help his parents and analyze a group of 12 green stocks , so he can support nad provide better answer for his parent's investment decisions. So Steve asked me a favor to help him out and made a workbook and to create a flexible macro for running multiple stock, so he can analyze the dataset. In order to do so, I need to design a workbookk using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel to provid each stocks annual volume and yearly return on investment for each stock.

Steve loves the workbook that I prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze each stock and he can expand hi research as well.

Purpose
Steve wants to analyze which stocks give a higher yearly return. if I run the code for each individual stocks , it may take extra time but it will give us results. NOe i take the advantage of the refractored code of VBA, I will improve the workbook efficiency, only clicking by one button. I will also going to find outthe execution time for each year analysis.
