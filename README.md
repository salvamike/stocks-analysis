# Green-Stock-Analysis 

## Project Overview Background 

Steve requires help in a project for his parents and analyze a group of 12 green stocks, 
to provide better answer for his parent's investment decisions based on statistical and more graphically explanation. Steve asked me a favor to help him out and made a workbook and to create a flexible macro for running multiple stock, He can analyze the dataset. 
In order to do so, I need to design a workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel to provide each stocks annual volume 
and yearly return on investment for each stock.

Steve enjoys the workbook that we have prepared for him based on data provided and funneled down to represent all needed. At the click of a button, 
he can analyze each stock and he can expand hi research as well.

## Results 

From the below analysis it is clear between 2017 and 2018 a shift in sentiment happened on green stocks, with the notable expectations of ENPH and RUN. Both ENPTH and RUN produced outsized returns in both 2017 and 2018 while green stocks on a whole performed poorly after having a healthy 2017. It is also notable that both ENPH and RUN had higher trading volumes on average then their peer group in both years, which could indicate higher interest in these stocks from the broader market.

## Summary

Advantages or Disadvantages of refactoring code? The purpose of refactoring code, and its primary advantage, is to make the code efficient. By being more efficient the code is able to run faster, be updated or edited in a quicker manner, and can be duplicated or reused with relative ease. The major disadvantage the general code is more sequential than the refactored code and therefore can be easier for someone not familiar with the code to read.

Pros and cons of applying refactoring to the green stocks VBA script? The major pro is the increased speed and efficiency with which the code is executed. Through refactoring less loops are needed and therefore the code runs faster. With less loops it is also easier to add news lines of code and modify the existing code. The major disadvantage, however, is that the refactored code is harder to read and understand if you are not the originator and take long breaks in between looking at the code.
