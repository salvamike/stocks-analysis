# Green-Stock-Analysis 
Project Overview Background 

Steve requires help in a project for his parents and analyze a group of 12 green stocks, 
to provide better answer for his parent's investment decisions based on statistical and more graphically explanation. Steve asked me a favor to help him out and made a workbook and to create a flexible macro for running multiple stock, He can analyze the dataset. 
In order to do so, I need to design a workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel to provide each stocks annual volume 
and yearly return on investment for each stock.

Steve enjoys the workbook that we have prepared for him based on data provided and funneled down to represent all needed. At the click of a button, 
he can analyze each stock and he can expand hi research as well.
